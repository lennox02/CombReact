    comment: 'I have had the absolute worst experience with their customer service. Bought a cordless vacuum on Black Friday and when it came in the mail, it didn’t even charge at all so we chatted with a representative or a bot, whatever it was and was ensured we would get a replacement. Re sent it back out to suwon and just got an email a few days later saying they were out of stock of pretty much everything I want. Says to contact them via chat and no ones available. At this point I’m so annoyed that I should never have ventured away from shark products and I just want a better replacement or my money back. Super annoyed. Worst customer service',

    comment: 'Worst customer service EVER! I ordered one of theses vacuum’s during their cyber sale on Monday. They pulled the payment and than I received a email that the order was canceled. When I contacted why she said the funds didn’t go through, I assured her they did and had me get my bank on the phone to confirm after I had already explained to her. Keep in mind this took a hour today with waiting and back and forth. She than assured me she re setup the order and I would get a confirmation in 1-2 days. Just now I get a call from them saying everything had been canceled even though the money is still withdrawn and the lady had never reset up the order. The 2nd lady said I would see the return and to reorder when I asked if I would still get the cyber sale price she said no (even though the screw up was on their payment side) she said I could pick something else out that’s on sale but not the item I previously ordered Monday due to it no longer being on sale.

    comment: 'Just spent $800 for a V11 and after fully charging the batteries, used it for exactly 5 minutes before the beater brush stopped working. Of course customer service is non-existent as far as talking/chatting/texting with an actual person - everything is automated. But to say I’m angry, frustrated, and disappointed would be a major understatement. We‘ll see how quickly they resolve the issue, but I’m not very confident of a satisfactory outcome. Hopefully they prove me wrong!!!',

    comment: 'Bought a V11. Currently under warranty so after it stopped working, no problem contact support. And down the rabbit hole we went. The online support refers you to their phone support, that then funnels you into a sms text based support. Eventually their chatbot diagnosed it as needing to be replaced, and that someone would contact me via email to send me a shipping label. Someone did email me asking for my EMAIL address so they could send me a shipping label. Which they obviously had since they had just emailed me. I tried to respond back and it went to a no reply mailbox. Began the whole thing over again and same result. I am unable to get anywhere with dyson support.',
